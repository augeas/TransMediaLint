    This is some test text that contains some words that should trigger the linter
    and produce a negative score

    For example, it has the word post op which can be offensive. This scores -5

    (-5)

    It also has this: sex change - another -5

    (-10)

    In addition, it refers to gender identity disorder which is an inappropriate thing to refer
    to, scoring -1

    Finally, it refers to a man by scare quotes: "man" - offensively undermining -5
